## Want to help make Peregrine better? 

Peregrine is a truly community-driven project. We want to get a good feedback loop going with questions, issues and feature requests circulating in this repo. 

We've created a few spots where you can add your feedback. As ideas and suggestions are added to these places, we'll try grouping together similar tickets together and open them up for discussion with the community at large. The idea is that we work together as a community to determine priority fixes, features and enhancements before diving into development. 

If you have an issue or notice a bug that you think needs fixing, log an issue at https://github.com/peregrine-cms/enhancements/issues

If you have an idea for a feature or general improvement you'd like to throw out to the community, start a discussion at https://github.com/peregrine-cms/enhancements/discussions

Also, if you have feedback on how to improve this enhancements area, please let us know -- we want to make this work for all users of Peregrine.

Let's make Peregrine something great together!
